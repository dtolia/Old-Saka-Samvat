# Old Śaka Samvat
Introduced by the Śakadvipi Brahmins, this calendar not only marks the rise of the Imperial Śakas but also pioneered solar astronomy in the subcontinent.

While originally a sidereal calendar, it was converted to a tropical system by Prof. M.N. Saha and the Calendar Reform Committee in 1957. This modernization ensured accurate seasonal alignment, making it invaluable for agriculture. 

Old Śaka Samvat, therefore, stands as a harmonious blend of ancient tradition and modern utility.
