# Old-Saka-Samvat
LaTeX for Saka Samvat calendar with seasons and Gregorian dates.

Introduced by the Sakadvipi Brahmins, this calendar not only marks the rise of the Imperial Sakas but also revolutionized solar astronomy in the subcontinent.

While originally a sidereal calendar, it was converted to a tropical system by Prof. M.N. Saha and the Calendar Reform Committee in 1957. This modernization ensured accurate seasonal alignment, making it invaluable for agriculture. 

Old Saka Samvat, therefore, stands as a harmonious blend of ancient tradition and modern utility.
