# Frequently Asked Questions

## (Q) Today, Vikram Samvat calendars are made using Drik Panchang. So the problem of seasonal inaccuracy is gone, right?
Drik Panchang was formalized in modern times (and popularized in recent decades) as a method of calendar calculation based on direct astronomical observations and precise mathematical astronomy—that is, planetary positions as they actually appear in the sky.

Using this method, the Vikram Samvat calendar is calculated by determining the exact starting moments of Tithis, Nakshatras, and Sankrantis, which you see in the Panchang.

However, Drik Panchang does not eliminate seasonal drift, because it is still fundamentally based on the sidereal year, not the tropical (seasonal) year.

## (Q) The Ayanamsa is used to correct the Vikram Samvat, right?
Yes—but only in a specific technical sense.

Ayanamsa is used to calculate the correct sidereal planetary positions for the Vikram Samvat Panchang. It is not used to “correct” the calendar to keep it aligned with the seasons (i.e., the tropical year).

Modern astronomy uses the Tropical Zodiac (Sayana), which is season-based and continuously shifts due to the precession of the equinoxes. The Vikram Samvat, however, relies on the Sidereal Zodiac (Nirayana), which is fixed relative to the stars.

If you take raw planetary data from a modern observatory (such as NASA), it provides tropical longitudes. To generate a Vikram Samvat Panchang, astrologers apply the Ayanamsa to convert these tropical positions into sidereal ones.

Formula:
Sidereal Longitude = Tropical Longitude − Ayanamsa

This conversion determines the exact start of Tithis (lunar days), Nakshatras, and Sankrantis (such as the Sun’s entry into Capricorn) shown in the Panchang.

But this is not a seasonal correction.

Ayanamsa merely measures the accumulated drift caused by the precession of the equinoxes; it does not fix the calendar to the seasons. Because the Vikram Samvat is sidereal (star-based) and does not adjust for precession, it slowly drifts away from the seasons.

For example, Makar Sankranti historically coincided with the Winter Solstice (around December 21). Due to the absence of seasonal correction, it has now shifted to January 14/15.

Since Ayanamsa preserves the sidereal reference rather than correcting toward the tropical year, this gap will continue to increase. In about 3,000 years, Makar Sankranti will fall in February, and in about 9,000 years, it will occur in June, during midsummer.

## (Q) What about the “Adhik Maas” correction in Vikram Samvat?
The primary “correction” in the Vikram Samvat Panchang is Adhik Maas (the intercalary or extra month).

Adhik Maas is used to align the Lunar Year (approximately 354 days) with the Solar Sidereal Year (approximately 365.25 days). This ensures that festivals do not drift continuously through the year, as happens in purely lunar calendars like the Islamic calendar.

However, Adhik Maas does not correct the solar year to the seasons. It aligns lunar months with the sidereal solar cycle, not with the tropical (seasonal) year.

## (Q) So, is a sidereal calendar a bad calendar?
Not necessarily. It is not “bad,” but it serves a different purpose than the calendar most people are familiar with. Whether it is good or bad depends entirely on what you want to measure.

If your goal is to track seasons (agriculture, climate patterns, solstices, equinoxes), then yes—the sidereal calendar is flawed. Because it ignores the Earth’s axial precession, its months slowly drift away from the seasons they were originally associated with.

For example, “Chaitra” traditionally signifies spring, but in a few thousand years, Chaitra will occur during winter.

However, if your goal is to track the stars (astronomy, navigation, or cosmic positioning), the sidereal calendar is actually superior. It is locked to the physical universe beyond our solar system.

If the sidereal calendar says the Moon is in Ashwini Nakshatra, you can point a telescope at the sky and the Moon will indeed be located in front of Beta Arietis (Ashwini).

By contrast, if a tropical calendar says the Sun is in “Aries” (around March 21), and you observe the sky, the Sun will actually be positioned in front of the stars of Pisces. The tropical system prioritizes seasons, not the visible stellar background.
