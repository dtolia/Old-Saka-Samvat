# The Origin of the Śaka Samvat and the Case for the Old Śaka Era

## The Historical Problem
The Śaka Samvat, beginning in 78 A.D., occupies a unique position in Indian chronology. Unlike other Indian eras, it became the era par excellence of Indian astronomy and calendrical computation, used continuously by astronomers from at least the time of Varāhamihira (6th century A.D.) to the present day. Yet its origin has long remained problematic.

Two facts stand out:

* The Śaka Era is already fully operational, standardized, and widely accepted by the early centuries of the Christian era.
* No clear founding event or imperial proclamation in 78 A.D. adequately explains its emergence.

This tension between widespread technical use and obscure origin demands a deeper historical explanation. The Old Śaka Samvat (OSS) hypothesis resolves this difficulty by demonstrating that the “classical” Śaka Era is not a new creation of 78 A.D., but the continuation—after systematic omission of centuries—of a much older era founded in Central Asia.

## The Old Śaka Era: Foundation in Central Asia (123 B.C.)
Historical and archaeological evidence indicates that the Śakas, under pressure from the Hūṇas, moved southward from the Trans-Oxus region and attacked the Parthian Empire beginning in 129 B.C. After a prolonged conflict lasting approximately seven years, they decisively defeated the Parthians and wrested control of Bactria in 123 B.C., killing the Pallava (Parthian) emperor Artabanus II.

It is highly probable—indeed historically expected—that the Śakas founded an era to commemorate this accession to imperial power. Such practice was standard in the Hellenistic and Iranian world:

* The Yavanas (Greeks) used the Seleucid Era (312 B.C.).
* The Pallavas/Pahlavas (Parthians) used the Parthian Era (248 B.C.).
* It would be anomalous if the Śakas, upon attaining similar imperial status, did not establish an era of their own.

This era, sometimes called the Azes Era after the probable Śaka leader (distinct from later Azes I and II of Taxila), was reckoned using Macedonian months and Graeco-Chaldean calendrical methods, consistent with Near Eastern practice. Its starting point is best fixed at 123 B.C., rather than 129 B.C., because the latter marks the beginning of hostilities, whereas 123 B.C. marks the decisive conquest and consolidation of power.

This is the Old Śaka Era.

## Transmission into India and Early Adaptation
As the Śakas expanded into Afghanistan, the north-western Punjab, and later deeper into India, they carried this era with them. Numismatic and epigraphic evidence shows a gradual cultural transition:

* Early coins and inscriptions use Greek language and Graeco-Chaldean dating.
* Later issues incorporate Kharoṣṭhī and Brāhmī scripts.
* Indian lunar months begin to replace Macedonian months, especially in religious records.
* Whenever Indian months are used, they are pūrṇimānta, consistent with Maurya and Sātavāhana practice.

During the first two centuries of the Old Śaka Era, an important convention appears: the omission of hundreds in year numbers. This practice, attested elsewhere in Indian chronology, becomes crucial for understanding later developments.

## The Kuṣāṇa Evidence and the Omission of Hundreds
The Kuṣāṇas, themselves a Śaka-related ruling group, provide decisive epigraphic confirmation of this practice.

At first glance, Kuṣāṇa inscriptions appear to terminate abruptly at year 98 of Vasudeva I, with no Indian records exceeding year 100. This apparent chronological break long puzzled historians.

The problem was resolved by Van Lohuizen de Leeuw, who demonstrated that in numerous Mathurā-region Brāhmī inscriptions, dates such as 5, 12, 15, 22, 35, 50, and 57 are actually 105, 112, 115, 122, 135, 150, and 157, with the hundred omitted. Prosopographical and palaeographical analysis—most notably the case of the Jaina preacher Aryā Vāsulā—makes any alternative interpretation untenable.

Thus:

* Kuṣāṇa records extend well into the second century of the era.
* The so-called “Kaniṣka Era” is not a new era at all.
* Year 1 of Kaniṣka corresponds to year 201 of the Old Śaka Era, if two centuries are omitted.

With the Old Śaka Era beginning in 123 B.C., this places Kaniṣka’s accession in 78 A.D., exactly the epoch of the classical Śaka Samvat.

## The Western Kṣatrapas and the Continuity of the Era
Independent confirmation comes from western India.

* Nahapāna and Uṣavadāta use an “unknown” era dated to years 41–46.
* When read as Old Śaka years with 100 omitted, these correspond to the early first century A.D. and align perfectly with the reign of Gautamīputra Śātakarṇi.
* After a chronological gap of roughly a century, the house of Castana (Western Kṣatrapas of Ujjain) appears, using the same era.

The Western Kṣatrapas never claim imperial status and never name the era in their early records. It is therefore implausible that they founded it. Rather, they inherited an already well-established era and continued its use—this time without further omission of hundreds.

From their records onward, this reckoning flows uninterrupted into later Indian tradition as the Śaka Era.

## Astronomical Adoption and Siddhāntic Synthesis
The decisive factor in the survival and dominance of the Śaka Era lies in astronomy.

Early Indian astronomers—many associated with the Śākadvīpī Brāhmaṇas—adopted the Śaka Era for all astronomical and calendrical computations. Graeco-Chaldean astronomy, brought by the Śakas, merged with older Indian calendrical concepts to form Siddhānta Jyotiṣa.

Key developments include:

* Exclusive use of the Śaka Era in astronomical calculation.
* Introduction of tithi and nakṣatra-based dating in inscriptions (e.g., Rudrasimha, 181 A.D.).
* Later addition of weekday notation under the Guptas.
* Persistent use of the Śaka Era in horoscopic astrology, a practice continuing to this day.

No other Indian era achieved this technical centrality.

## Conclusion: Why the Old Śaka Samvat Hypothesis Is Most Probable
The Old Śaka Samvat hypothesis succeeds because it explains, in a single coherent framework:

* The otherwise inexplicable appearance of a fully formed era in 78 A.D.
* The Kuṣāṇa omission of hundreds and the artificial termination of early dates.
* The chronological placement of Nahapāna, the Kuṣāṇas, and the Western Kṣatrapas.
* The inability of minor satrapal dynasties to have founded such an era.
* The unparalleled astronomical dominance of the Śaka Era in India.

Under this reconstruction:

* The Śaka Samvat of 78 A.D. is the Old Śaka Era of 123 B.C., with 200 years omitted.
* The “Kaniṣka Era” is not an independent era.
* The continuity from Central Asian imperial practice to Indian astronomical tradition becomes historically intelligible.

While absolute certainty in ancient chronology is unattainable, the OSS hypothesis integrates inscriptional, numismatic, historical, and astronomical evidence with a consistency unmatched by alternative theories. It therefore stands as the most convincing explanation for the origin and evolution of the Śaka Samvat.
